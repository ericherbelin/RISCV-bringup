# RISCV-bringup
manual for initial RISCV bringup

The first step we took in the beginning of the project was to decide on which implementations we will focus. 
We used the official RISCV website to get a list of some of the implementations exist, and then we explored each of the implementations.
For each implementation, we checked few things: what is the basic ISA version used, does it support any extensions, in which HDL it is written, who is the developer, does it have any working compiler and/or debugger and if it possible to burn to FPGA.
